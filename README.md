# DeFind staking based Search Engine for the Web 3.0

DeFind is a project to tackle one of the most daunting tasks of the web in a new way: **finding stuff**.


Web 2.0 Search Engines such as Google employ web crawlers to feed data into a search algorithm.

This approach creates a weird mix of incentives that we consider harmful to the open web:

- There is an incentive of website owners to trick the web crawlers, to make their content more relevant than it is
- Using traffic statistics creates a grey market of traffic dealers employing bots or clickworkers to generate artificial traffic
- The algorithm has to be kept a trade secret in order to not be exploitable

As a result, Search Engine Optimizers (SEO) find that the efficacy of their work is hard to verify and there are a lot of bad actors among their ranks.
There is just too much "magic" involved.


DeFind turns the game around.
Instead of a secret algorithm and a webcrawler, DeFind employs a public algorithm and let the owners of websites / canisters choose the input to the algorithm themselves.
